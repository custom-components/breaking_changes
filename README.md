_Component to show potential breaking_changes in the current published version based on your loaded components._

## How it works.

This uses [https://hachanges.halfdecent.io/](https://hachanges.halfdecent.io/) to get the breaking changes.  
[`hachanges`][hachanges] is a website I made a couple of months before this to serve as an easy registry of breaking changes.  

[`hachanges`][hachanges] uses web scraping on the blogpost for the release that it tries to show, and determine which breaking change to list.

This will list breaking changes on versions for the next after the one you are running up to the latest stable version.

**Examples:**  
You run version `0.87.0`, and `0.92.0` is published, it will show breaking changes for `0.88`, `0.89`, `0.90`, `0.91`, `0.92`.  
You run version `0.92.0`, and `0.92.0` is published, it will not show anything.  
You run version `0.91.0`, and `0.92.0` is published, it will show breaking changes for `0.92`.

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Show info about potential issue with your configuration before upgrading.

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `breaking_changes`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/breaking_changes/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Add `breaking_changes:` to your HA configuration.

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/breaking_changes/__init__.py
custom_components/breaking_changes/const.py
custom_components/breaking_changes/sensor.py
custom_components/breaking_changes/manifest.json
```

## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
breaking_changes:
```

## Configuration options 

Key | Type | Required | Default | Description
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
`name` | `string` | `False` | `Potential breaking changes` | Custom name for the entities.
